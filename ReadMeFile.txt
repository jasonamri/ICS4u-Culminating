Client Introduction


Santa Claus is a well known Christmas icon. Having faithfully delivered gifts to the children of the world for centuries.
Although in recent years due to the exponentially growing population of children in the world the North Pole team have
become overwhelmed with extreme amounts of toy assignment and child initialization protocol. In order to fix these issues
the S.A.A.N.T.A team has been tasked to create a program in order to expedite this process and help out the North Pole
eradicate issues with this initialization of children and the assignment of toys to each child and each elf to produce.
